The Domain Name System
======================

In the early days of the Internet, there were only a few number of hosts (mainly minicomputers) connected to the network. The most popular applications were remote login and file transfer. By 1983, there were already five hundred hosts attached to the Internet. Each of these hosts were identified by a unique IPv4 address. Forcing human users to remember the IPv4 addresses of the remote hosts that they want to use was not user-friendly. Human users prefer to remember names, and use them when needed. Using names as aliases for addresses is a common technique in Computer Science. It simplifies the development of applications and allows the developer to ignore the low level details. For example, by using a programming language instead of writing machine code, a developer can write software without knowing whether the variables that it uses are stored in memory or inside registers. 

Because names are at a higher level than addresses, they allow (both in the example of programming above, and on the Internet) to treat addresses as mere technical identifiers, which can change at will. Only the names are stable. On today's Internet, where switching to another ISP means changing your IP addresses, the user-friendliness of domain names is less important (they are not often typed by users) but their stability remains a very important, may be their most important property.

.. index:: Network Information Center, hosts.txt

The first solution that allowed applications to use names was the :term:`hosts.txt` file. This file is similar to the symbol table found in compiled code. It contains the mapping between the name of each Internet host and its associated IP address [#fhosts]_. It was maintained by the SRI International Network Information Center (NIC). When a new host was connected to the network, the system administrator had to register its name and IP address at the NIC. The NIC updated the :term:`hosts.txt` file on its server. All Internet hosts regularly retrieved the updated :term:`hosts.txt` file from the server maintained by SRI_. This file was stored at a well-known location on each Internet host (see :rfc:`952`) and networked applications could use it to find the IP address corresponding to a name. 

A :term:`hosts.txt` file can be used when there are up to a few hundred hosts on the network. However, it is clearly not suitable for a network containing thousands or millions of hosts. A key issue in a large network is to define a suitable naming scheme. The ARPANet initially used a flat naming space, i.e. each host was assigned a unique name. To limit collisions between names, these names usually contained the name of the institution and a suffix to identify the host inside the institution (a kind of poor man's hierarchical naming scheme). On the ARPANet few institutions had several hosts connected to the network. 

However, the limitations of a flat naming scheme became clear before the end of the ARPANet and :rfc:`819` proposed a hierarchical naming scheme. While :rfc:`819` discussed the possibility of organising the names as a directed graph, the Internet opted eventually for a tree structure capable of containing all names. In this tree, the top-level domains are those that are directly attached to the root. The first top-level domain was `.arpa` [#fdnstimeline]_. This top-level name was initially added as a suffix to the names of the hosts attached to the ARPANet and listed in the `hosts.txt` file. In 1984, the `.gov`, `.edu`, `.com`, `.mil` and `.org` generic top-level domain names were added and :rfc:`1032` proposed the utilisation of the two letter :term:`ISO-3166` country codes as top-level domain names. Since :term:`ISO-3166` defines a two letter code for each country recognised by the United Nations, this allowed all countries to automatically have a top-level domain. These domains include `.be` for Belgium, `.fr` for France, `.us` for the USA, `.ie` for Ireland or `.tv` for Tuvalu, a group of small islands in the Pacific and `.tm` for Turkmenistan. Today, the set of top-level domain-names is managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (:term:`ICANN`). Recently, :term:`ICANN` added a dozen of generic top-level domains that are not related to a country and the `.cat` top-level domain has been registered for the Catalan language. There are ongoing discussions within :term:`ICANN` to increase the number of top-level domains.

Each top-level domain is managed by an organisation that decides how sub-domain names can be registered. Most top-level domain names use a first-come first served system, and allow anyone to register domain names, but there are some exceptions. For example, `.gov` is reserved for the US government, `.int` is reserved for international organisations and names in the `.ca` are mainly `reserved <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ca>`_ for companies or users who are present in Canada.

   The tree of domain names

:rfc:`1035` recommended the following :term:`BNF` for fully qualified
domain names, to allow host names with a syntax which works with all
applications (the domain names themselves have a much richer syntax).

.. figure:: pkt/dns-bnf.png
   :align: center

   BNF of the fully qualified host names

This grammar specifies that a host name is an ordered list of labels separated by the dot (`.`) character. Each label can contain letters, numbers and the hyphen character (`-`) [#fidn]_. Fully qualified domain names are read from left to right. The first label is a hostname or a domain name followed by the hierarchy of domains and ending with the root implicitly at the right. The top-level domain name must be one of the registered TLDs [#ftld]_. For example, in the above figure, `www.whitehouse.gov` corresponds to a host named `www` inside the `whitehouse` domain that belongs to the `gov` top-level domain. `info.ucl.ac.be` corresponds to the `info` domain inside the `ucl` domain that is included in the `ac` sub-domain of the `be` top-level domain.

This hierarchical naming scheme is a key component of the Domain Name System (DNS). The DNS is a distributed database that contains mappings between fully qualified domain names and IP addresses. The DNS uses the client-server model. The clients are hosts that need to retrieve the mapping for a given name. Each :term:`nameserver` stores part of the distributed database and answers the queries sent by clients. There is at least one :term:`nameserver` that is responsible for each domain. In the figure below, domains are represented by circles and there are three hosts inside domain `dom` (`h1`, `h2` and `h3`) and three hosts inside domain `a.sdom1.dom`. As shown in the figure below, a sub-domain may contain both host names and sub-domains.

.. figure:: png/app-fig-006-c.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50 

   A simple tree of domain names

A :term:`nameserver` that is responsible for domain `dom` can directly answer the following queries :
 
 - the IP address of any host residing directly inside domain `dom` (e.g. `h2.dom` in the figure above)
 - the nameserver(s) that are responsible for any direct sub-domain of domain `dom` (i.e. `sdom1.dom` and `sdom2.dom` in the figure above, but not `z.sdom1.dom`)

To retrieve the mapping for host `h2.dom`, a client sends its query to the name server that is responsible for domain `.dom`. The name server directly answers the query. To retrieve a mapping for `h3.a.sdom1.dom` a DNS client first sends a query to the name server that is responsible for the `.dom` domain. This nameserver returns the nameserver that is responsible for the `sdom1.dom` domain. This nameserver can now be contacted to obtain the nameserver that is responsible for the `a.sdom1.dom` domain. This nameserver can be contacted to retrieve the mapping for the `h3.a.sdom1.dom` name. Thanks to this organisation of the nameservers, it is possible for a DNS client to obtain the mapping of any host inside the `.dom` domain or any of its subdomains. To ensure that any DNS client will be able to resolve any fully qualified domain name, there are special nameservers that are responsible for the root of the domain name hierarchy. These nameservers are called :term:`root nameserver`. There are currently about a dozen root nameservers [#fdozen]_.   

Each root nameserver maintains the list [#froot]_ of all the nameservers that are responsible for each of the top-level domain names and their IP addresses [#frootv6]_. All root nameservers are synchronised and provide the same answers. By querying any of the root nameservers, a DNS client can obtain the nameserver that is responsible for any top-level-domain name. From this nameserver, it is possible to resolve any domain name. 

To be able to contact the root nameservers, each DNS client must know their IP addresses. This implies, that DNS clients must maintain an up-to-date list of the IP addresses of the root nameservers [#fnamed.root]_. Without this list, it is impossible to contact the root nameservers. Forcing all Internet hosts to maintain the most recent version of this list would be difficult from an operational point of view. To solve this problem, the designers of the DNS introduced a special type of DNS server : the DNS resolvers. A :term:`resolver` is a server that provides the name resolution service for a set of clients. A network usually contains a few resolvers. Each host in these networks is configured to send all its DNS queries via one of its local resolvers. These queries are called `recursive queries` as the :term:`resolver` must recurse through the hierarchy of nameservers to obtain the `answer`. 

DNS resolvers have several advantages over letting each Internet host query directly nameservers. Firstly, regular Internet hosts do not need to maintain the up-to-date list of the IP addresses of the root servers. Secondly, regular Internet hosts do not need to send queries to nameservers all over the Internet. Furthermore, as a DNS resolver serves a large number of hosts, it can cache the received answers. This allows the resolver to quickly return answers for popular DNS queries and reduces the load on all DNS servers [JSBM2002]_.  

The last component of the Domain Name System is the DNS protocol. The DNS protocol runs above both the datagram service and the bytestream services. In practice, the datagram service is used when short queries and responses are exchanged, and the bytestream service is used when longer responses are expected. In this section, we will only discuss the utilisation of the DNS protocol above the datagram service. This is the most frequent utilisation of the DNS.

.. index:: DNS message format

DNS messages are composed of five parts that are named sections in :rfc:`1035`. The first three sections are mandatory and the last two sections are optional. The first section of a DNS message is its `Header`. It contains information about the type of message and the content of the other sections. The second section contains the `Question` sent to the name server or resolver. The third section contains the `Answer` to the `Question`. When a client sends a DNS query, the `Answer` section is empty. The fourth section, named `Authority`, contains information about the servers that can provide an authoritative answer if required. The last section contains additional information that is supplied by the resolver or server but was not requested in the question.

The header of DNS messages is composed of 12 bytes and its structure is shown in the figure below.

.. figure:: pkt/dnsheader.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 100

   DNS header

The `ID` (identifier) is a 16-bits random value chosen by the client. When a client sends a question to a DNS server, it remembers the question and its identifier. When a server returns an answer, it returns in the `ID` field the identifier chosen by the client. Thanks to this identifier, the client can match the received answer with the question that it sent.

.. http://www.secureworks.com/research/articles/dns-cache-poisoning

The `QR` flag is set to `0` in DNS queries and `1` in DNS answers. The
`Opcode` is used to specify the type of query. For instance, a :term:`standard query` is when a client sends a `name` and the server returns the corresponding `data` and an update request is when the client sends a `name` and new `data` and the server then updates its database.

The `AA` bit is set when the server that sent the response has `authority` for the domain name found in the question section. In the original DNS deployments, two types of servers were considered : `authoritative` servers and `non-authoritative` servers. The `authoritative` servers are managed by the system administrators responsible for a given domain. They always store the most recent information about a domain. `Non-authoritative` servers are servers or resolvers that store DNS information about external domains without being managed by the owners of a domain. They may thus provide answers that are out of date. From a security point of view, the `authoritative` bit is not an absolute indication about the validity of an answer. Securing the Domain Name System is a complex problem that was only addressed satisfactorily recently by the utilisation of cryptographic signatures in the DNSSEC extensions to DNS described in :rfc:`4033`. However, these extensions are outside the scope of this chapter. 

The `RD` (recursion desired) bit is set by a client when it sends a query to a resolver. Such a query is said to be `recursive` because the resolver will recurse through the DNS hierarchy to retrieve the answer on behalf of the client. In the past, all resolvers were configured to perform recursive queries on behalf of any Internet host. However, this exposes the resolvers to several security risks. The simplest one is that the resolver could become overloaded by having too many recursive queries to process. As of this writing, most resolvers [#f8888]_ only allow recursive queries from clients belonging to their company or network and discard all other recursive queries. The `RA` bit indicates whether the server supports recursion. The `RCODE` is used to distinguish between different types of errors. See :rfc:`1035`
for additional details. The last four fields indicate the size of the `Question`, `Answer`, `Authority` and `Additional` sections of the DNS message.


The last four sections of the DNS message contain `Resource Records` (RR).  All RRs have the same top level format shown in the figure below. 

.. figure:: pkt/dnsrr.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 100

   DNS Resource Records

In a `Resource Record` (`RR`), the `Name` indicates the name of the node to which this resource record pertains. The two bytes `Type` field indicate the type of resource record. The `Class` field was used to support the utilisation of the DNS in other environments than the Internet. 

The `TTL` field indicates the lifetime of the `Resource Record` in seconds. This field is set by the server that returns an answer and indicates for how long a client or a resolver can store the `Resource Record` inside its cache. A long `TTL` indicates a stable `RR`. Some companies use short `TTL` values for mobile hosts and also for popular servers. For example, a web hosting company that wants to spread the load over a pool of hundred servers can configure its nameservers to return different answers to different clients. If each answer has a small `TTL`, the clients will be forced to send DNS queries regularly. The nameserver will reply to these queries by supplying the address of the less loaded server.

The `RDLength` field is the length of the `RData` field that contains the information of the type specified in the `Type` field.

Several types of DNS RR are used in practice. The `A` type is used to encode the IPv4 address that corresponds to the specified name. The `AAAA` type is used to encode the IPv6 address that corresponds to the specified name. A `NS` record contains the name of the DNS server that is responsible for a given domain. For example, a query for the `A` record associated to the `www.ietf.org` name returns the following answer.

.. figure:: pkt/www-ietf-org.png
   :align: center

   Query for the `A` record of `www.ietf.org` 

This answer contains several pieces of information. First, the name `www.ietf.org` is associated to IP address `64.170.98.32`. Second, the `ietf.org` domain is managed by six different nameservers. Three of these nameservers are reachable via IPv4 and IPv6. Two of them are not reachable via IPv6 and `ns0.ietf.org` is only reachable via IPv6. A query for the `AAAA` record associated to `www.ietf.org` returns `2001:1890:1112:1::20` and the same authority and additional sections.

`CNAME` (or canonical names) are used to define aliases. For example `www.example.com` could be a `CNAME` for `pc12.example.com` that is the actual name of the server on which the web server for `www.example.com` runs. 

.. note:: Reverse DNS and in-addr.arpa

 The DNS is mainly used to find the IP address that correspond to a given name. However, it is sometimes useful to obtain the name that corresponds to an IP address. This done by using the `PTR` (`pointer`) `RR`. The `RData` part of a `PTR` `RR` contains the name while the `Name` part of the `RR` contains the IP address encoded in the `in-addr.arpa` domain. IPv4 addresses are encoded in the `in-addr.arpa` by reversing the four digits that compose the dotted decimal representation of the address. For example, consider IPv4 address `192.0.2.11`. The hostname associated to this address can be found by requesting the `PTR` `RR` that corresponds to `11.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa`. A similar solution is used to support IPv6 addresses, see :rfc:`3596`.

An important point to note regarding the Domain Name System is its extensibility. Thanks to the `Type` and `RDLength` fields, the format of the Resource Records can easily be extended. Furthermore, a DNS implementation that receives a new Resource Record that it does not understand can ignore the record while still being able to process the other parts of the message. This allows, for example, a DNS server that only supports IPv4 to ignore the IPv6 addresses listed in the DNS reply for `www.ietf.org` while still being able to correctly parse the Resource Records that it understands. This extensibility allowed the Domain Name System to evolve over the years while still preserving the backward compatibility with already deployed DNS implementations.
