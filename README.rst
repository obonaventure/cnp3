Like any open-source project, the future of Computer Networking Principles, Protocols and Practice will depend on the work of contributors. Most of the text has been written by Olivier Bonaventure. Laurent Vanbever, Virginie Van den Schriek, Damien Saucez and Mickael Hoerdt have contributed to exercises. Stéphane Bortzmeyer has provided many comments that have improved the book.

This directory is structured as follows :

https://github.com/obonaventure/cnp3/tree/master/book contains the source code for the entire book

https://github.com/obonaventure/cnp3/tree/master/book-fr contains a partial translation in French being written by Virginie Van den Schrieck

https://github.com/obonaventure/cnp3/tree/master/book-es will contain a translation in Spanish
 
The book was compiled on MacOS/X Snow Leopard using sphinx. inkscape is required to convert some of the images in png format. Most of the images will be converted to the SVG format to improve the portability of the textbook. python is also required. When US and British spelling disagree, we opt for US spelling.

The textbook was written on a Mac running Snow Leopard, but it should rebuild on other Unix based systems. Comments on issues in rebuilding the textbook are welcome.
