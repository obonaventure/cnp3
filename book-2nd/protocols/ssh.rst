Remote login
============

One of the initial motivations for building computer networks was
to allow users to access remote computers over the networks. In the 1960s
and 1970s, the mainframes and the emerging minicomputers were composed
of a central unit and a set of terminals connected through serial
lines or modems. The simplest protocol that was designed to access
remote computers over a network is probably :term:`telnet` :rfc:`854`.
:term:`telnet` runs over TCP and a telnet server listens on port `23` by
default. The TCP connection used by telnet is bidirectional, both the client
and the server can send data over it. The data exchanged over such a
connection is essentially the characters that are typed by the user on the
client machine and the text output of the processes running on the server
machine with a few exceptions (e.g. control characters, characters to control
the terminal like VT-100, ...) . The default character set for
telnet is the ASCII character set, but the extensions specified
in :rfc:`5198` support the utilisation
of Unicode characters.

From a security viewpoint, the main drawback of :term:`telnet` is that all
the information, including the usernames, passwords and commands,
is sent in cleartext over a TCP connection. This implies that
an eavesdropper could easily capture the passwords used by anyone
on an unprotected network. Various software tools exist to
automate this collection of information. For this reason,
:term:`telnet` is rarely used today to access remote computers.
It is usually replaced by :term:`ssh` or similar protocols.

The secure shell (ssh)
----------------------

The secure shell protocol was designed in the mid 1990s by T. Ylonen
to counter the eavesdropping attacks against :term:`telnet` and
similar protocols [Ylonen1996]_. :term:`ssh` became quickly popular and system
administrators encouraged its usage. The original version of :term:`ssh`
was freely available. After a few years, his author created a company
to distribute it commercially, but other programmers continued to
develop an open-source version of :term`ssh` called
`OpenSSH <http://www.openssh.com>`_.
Over the years, :term:`ssh` evolved
and became a flexible applicable whose usage extends beyond remote
login to support features such as file transfers, protocol tunnelling, ..
In this section, we only discuss the basic features of :term:`ssh` and explain
how it differs from :term:`telnet`. Entire books have been written to describe
:term:`ssh` in details [BS2005]_. An overview of the protocol
appeared in [Stallings2009]_.

The :term:`ssh` protocol runs directly above the TCP protocol.
Once the TCP bytestream
has been established, the client and the server exchange messages. The
first message exchanged is an ASCII line that announces the version of the
protocol and the version of the software implementation used by the client
and the server. These two lines are useful when debugging interoperability
problems and other issues.

The next message is the ``SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT`` message that is used
to negotiate the cryptographic algorithms that will be used for the
``ssh`` session. It is very important for security protocols to
include mechanisms that enable a negotiation of the cryptographic
algorithms that are used for several reasons. First, these
algorithms provide different levels of security. Some algorithms might
be considered totally secure and are recommended today while they could
become deprecated a few years laters after the publication of some
attacks. Second, these algorithms provide different levels of
performance and have different CPU and memory impacts.

In practice, an ``ssh`` implementation supports four types of
cryptographic algorithms :

 - key exchange
 - encryption
 - Message Authentication Code (MAC)
 - compression

The IANA_ maintains a `list of the cryptographic algorithms <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters/ssh-parameters.xhtml#ssh-parameters-16>`_
that can be used by ``ssh`` implementations. For each type of algorithm,
the client provides an ordered list of the algorithms that it supports
and agrees to use. The server compares the received list with its own list.
The outcome of the negotiation is a set of four algorithms [#fnull]_
that will be combined for this session.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Client",linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Server", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "SSH-clientP-clientS comments", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "SSH-serverP-serverS comments", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "SSH_MSG_KEX_INIT", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];


This negotiation of the cryptographic algorithms allows the implementations
to evolve when new algorithms are proposed. If a client is upgraded, it can
announce a new algorithm as its preferred one even if the server is not
yet upgraded.

Once the crypto algorithms have been negotiated, the key exchange algorithm is
used to negotiate a secret key that will be shared by the client and the server.
These key exchange algorithms include some variations over
the basic algorithms. As an example, let us analyse how the
Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm is used within the
``ssh`` protocol. In this case, each host has both a private and a public key.

 - the client generates the random number :math:`a` and sends
   :math:`A=g^{a} mod p` to the server
 - the server generates the random number :math:`b`. It then computes
   :math:`B=g^{b} mod p`, :math:`K=B^{a} mod p` and signs with its private
   key :math:`hash(V_{Client} || V_{Server} || KEX\_INIT_{Client} || KEX\_INIT_{Server} || Server_{pub} || A || B || K )`
   where :math:`V_{Server}` (resp. :math:`V_{Client}`) is the initial
   messages sent by the client (resp. server), :math:`KEX\_INIT_{Client}`
   (resp.  :math:`KEX\_INIT_{Server}`) is the key exchange message sent by
   the client (resp. server) and :math:`A`, :math:`B` and :math:`K` are the
   messages of the Diffie Hellman key exchange
 - the client can recompute :math:`K=A^{b} mod p` and verify the
   signature provided by the server

This is a slightly modified authenticated Diffie Hellman key exchange
with two interesting points. The first point is that
when the server authenticates the key exchange it does not provide a
certificate. This is because ``ssh`` assumes that the client will store
inside its cache the public key of the servers that it uses on a
regular basis. This assumption is valid for a protocol like ``ssh``
because users typically use it to interact with a small number of
servers, typically a few or a few tens. Storing this information does
not require a lot of storage. In practice, most ``ssh`` clients will
accept to connect to remote servers without knowing their public key before
the connection. In this case, the client issues a warning to the user who
can decide to accept or reject the key. This warning can be associated
with a fingerprint of the key, either as a sequence of letters or as
an ASCII art which can be posted on the web or elsewhere [#fdnsssh]_ by the
system administrator of the server. If a client connects to a server
whose public key does not match the stored one, a stronger warning is
issued because this could indicate a man-in-the-middle attack or that
the remote server has been compromised. It can also indicate that the server
has been upgraded and that a new key has been generated during this upgrade.

.. index:: downgrade attack

The second point is that the server authenticates not only the result
of the Diffie Hellman exchange but also a hash of all the information
sent and received during the exchange. This is important to prevent
:term:`downgrade attacks`. A `downgrade attack` is an attack where an
active attacker modifies the messages sent by the communicating hosts
(typically the client) to request the utilisation of weaker encryption
algorithms. Consider a client that supports two encryption schemes. The
preferred one uses 128 bits secret keys and the second one is an old
encryption scheme that uses 48 bits keys. This second algorithm is
kept for backward compatibility with older implementations. If an attacker
can remove the preferred algorithm from the list of encryption algorithms
supported by the client, he can force the server to use a weaker
encryption scheme that will be easier to break. Thanks
to the hash that covers all the messages exchanged by the server,
the downgrade attack cannot occur against ``ssh``. Algorithm agility is
a key requirement for security protocols that need to evolve when
encryption algorithms are broken by researchers. This agility cannot be
used without care and signing a hash of all the messages exchanged
is a technique that is frequently used to prevent downgrade attacks.

.. note:: Single use keys

   Thanks to the Diffie Hellman key exchange, the client and the
   servers share key :math:`K`. A naive implementation would probably
   directly use this key for all the cryptographic algorithms that
   have been negotiated for this session. Like most security protocols,
   ``ssh`` does not directly use key :math:`K`. Instead, it uses
   the negotiated hash function with different parameters [fsshkeys]_
   to allow the
   client and the servers to compute six keys from :math:`K` :

      - a key used by the client (resp. server) to encrypt the data that
        it sends
      - a key used by the client (resp. server) to authenticate the
        data that is sends
      - a key used by the client (resp. server) to initialize the
        negotiated encryption scheme (if required by this scheme)

   It is common practice among designers of security protocols to never
   use the same key for different purposes. For example, allowing the
   client and the server to use the same key to encrypt data could
   enable an attacker to launch a replay attack by resending to the
   client data that it has itself encrypted.


At this point, all the messages sent over the TCP connection will be encrypted
with the negotiated keys. The ``ssh`` protocol uses messages
that are encoded according to the Binary Packet Protocol defined in
:rfc:`4253`. Each of these messages contains the following information :

 - ``length`` : this is the length of the message in bytes, excluding the MAC
   and length fields
 - ``padding length`` : this is the number of random bytes that have been added
   at the end of the message.
 - ``payload`` : the data (after optional compression) passed by the user
 - ``padding`` : random bytes added in each message (at least four) to
   ensure that the message length is a multiple of the block size
   used by the negotiated encryption algorithm
 - ``MAC`` : this field is present if a Message Authentication Code has been
   negotiated for the session (in practice, using ``ssh`` without
   authentication is risky and this field should always be present). Note
   that to compute the MAC, an ``ssh`` implementation must maintain
   a message counter. This counter is incremented by one every time a
   message is sent and the MAC is computed with the negotiated authentication
   algorithm using the MAC key over the concatenation of
   the message counter and the unencrypted message.
   The message counter is not transmitted,
   but the recipient can easily recover its value. The ``MAC`` is computed as
   :math:`mac = MAC(key, sequence_number || unencrypted_message)` where the
   key is the negotiated authentication key.

.. index:: HMAC

.. note:: Authenticating messages with HMAC

   `ssh` is one example of a protocol that uses Message Authentication Codes
   (MAC) to authenticates the messages that are sent. A naïve implementation
   of such a MAC would be to simply use a hash function like SHA-1. However,
   such a construction would not be safe from a security viewpoint. Internet
   protocols usually rely on the HMAC construction defined in :rfc:`2104`.
   It works with any hash function (`H`) and a key (`K`). As an example, let
   us consider HMAC with the SHA-1 hash function. SHA-1 uses 20 bytes
   blocks and the block size will play an important role in the operation
   of HMAC. We first require the key to be as long as the block size. Since this
   key is the output of the key generation algorithm, this is one parameter
   of this algorithm.

   HMAC uses two padding strings : `ipad` (resp. `opad`)  which is a
   string containing 20 times byte ``0x36`` (resp. byte ``0x5C``). The HMAC
   is then computed as :math:`H[K \oplus opad, H(K \oplus ipad, data) ]`
   where :math:`\oplus` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. This computation
   has been shown to be stronger than the naïve :math:`H(K,data)` against
   some types of cryptographic attacks.



Among the various features of the ``ssh`` protocol, it is interesting
to mention how users are authenticated by the server. The ``ssh`` protocol
supports the classical username/password authentication (but both
the username and the password are transmitted over the secure encrypted
channel). In addition, ``ssh`` supports two authentication mechanisms that
rely on public keys. To use the first one, each user needs to generate
his/her own public/private key pair and store the public key on the server.
To be authenticated, the user needs to sign a message containing his/her
public key by using his/her private key. The server can easily verify the
validity of the signature since it already knows the user's public key.
The second authentication scheme is designed for hosts that trust each
other. Each host has a public/private key pair and stores the public keys
of the other hosts that it trusts. This is typically used in environments
such as university labs where each user could access any of the available
computers. If Alice has logged on ``computer1`` and wants to execute a
command on ``computer2``, she can create an ``ssh`` session on this computer
and type (again) her password. With the host-based authentication scheme,
``computer1`` signs a message with its private key to confirm that
it has already authenticated Alice. ``computer2`` would then accept
Alice's session without asking her credentials.

The ``ssh`` protocol includes other features that are beyond the
scope of this book. Additional details may be found in [BS2005]_.

           utilisation of no algorithm. This happens frequently for the
           compression algorithm that is not always used. For this,
           both the client and the server must announce ``null``
           in their ordered list of supported algorithms.
