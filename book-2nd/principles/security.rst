Network security
----------------

In the early days, data networks were mainly used by researchers and security
was not a concern. Only a small number of users were connected and capable of
using the network. Most of the devices attached to the network were openly
accessible and users were trusted. As the utilisation of the networks grew,
security concerns started to appear. In universities, researchers and professors
did not always trust their students and required some forms of
access control. On standalone computers, the most frequent access control
mechanism is the password. A `username` is assigned to
each user and when this user wants to access
the computer, he or she needs to provide his/her `username` and his/her
`password`. Most passwords are composed of a sequence of characters.
The strength of the password is function of the difficulty of guessing the
characters chosen by each user. Various guidelines have been defined on how
to select a good password [#fpasswords]_. Some systems require regular
modifications of the passwords chosen by their users.

.. introduce the need for passwords and exchanging them through the network

When the first computers were attached to data networks, applications were
developed to enable them to access to remote computers through the network.
To authenticate the remote users, these applications have also relied on
usernames and passwords. When a user connects to a distant computer, she
sends her username through the network and then provides her password
to confirm her `identity`. This authentication scheme can be represented
by the time sequence diagram shown below.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Host A", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Host B", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "DATA.req(I'm Alice)\n\n" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "DATA.ind(I'm Alice)\n\n" ];

      d=>c [ label = "DATA.req(Password:)\n\n" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "DATA.ind(Password:)\n\n" ];

      a=>b [ label = "DATA.req(1234xyz$)\n\n" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "DATA.ind(1234xyz$)\n\n" ];

      d=>c [ label = "DATA.req(Access)\n\n" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "DATA.ind(Access)\n\n" ];

.. index:: Alice, Bob

.. note:: Alice and Bob

   Alice and Bob are the first names that are used in examples for
   security techniques. They first appeared in a seminal paper by Diffie
   and Hellman [DH1976]_. Since then, Alice and Bob are the most
   frequently used names to represent the users who interact with a network.
   Other characters such as Eve or Mallory have been added over the years.
   We will explain their respective roles later.

Threats
^^^^^^^

When analysing security issues in computer networks, it is useful to
reason in terms of the
capabilities of the attacker who wants to exploit some breach in the security
of the network. Various types of attackers can be considered. Some
are very generic, others are specific to a given technology or network
protocol. In this section, we discuss some of the most
important threats that a network architect must take into account.

.. index:: passive attacker

The first type of attacker is called the `passive attacker`.
A `passive attacker` is someone who is
able to observe and usually store the information (e.g. the packets)
exchanged in a given network or subset of it (e.g. a specific link). This
attacker has access to all the data passing through this specific
link. This is the most basic type of attacker and many network technologies
are vulnerable to this type of attack. In the above example, a passive
attacker could easily capture the password sent by Alice and reuse it later
to be authenticated as Alice on the remote computer. This is illustrated
on the figure below where we do not show anymore the ``DATA.req`` and
``DATA.ind`` primitives but only show the messages that are exchanged.
Throughout this chapter, we will always use `Eve` as a user who is
able to eavesdrop the data passing in front of her.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Eve", linecolour=red],
      d [label="", linecolour=white],
      e [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      f [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>e [ label = "I'm Alice\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      e=>f [ label = "" ];

      e=>f [ label = "" ] ,
      e>>b [ label = "Password:\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>e [ label = "1234xyz$\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      e=>f [ label = "" ];

      e=>f [ label = "" ] ,
      e>>b [ label = "Access\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];


In the above example, `Eve` can capture all the packets exchanged by
Bob and Alice. This implies that Eve can discover Alice's username and
Alice's password. With this information, Eve can then authenticate as
Alice on Bob's computer and do whatever Alice is authorised to do. This
is a major problem from a security point of view. To prevent this attack,
Alice should never send her password in clear over a network where someone
could eavesdrop the information. In some networks, such as an open wireless
network, collecting all the data sent by a particular user is relatively
easy. In other networks, this is a bit more complex depending on the network
technology used, but various software packages exist to automate this process.
As will be described later, the best approach to prevent this type of attack
is to rely on cryptographic techniques to ensure that passwords are never
sent in clear.

.. index:: pervasive monitoring, Edward Snowden

.. note:: Pervasive monitoring

   In the previous example, we have explained how Eve could capture data from
   a particular user. This is not the only attack of this type. In 2013, based
   on documents collected by Edward Snowden, the press revealed that several
   governmental agencies were collecting lots of data on various links that
   compose the global Internet [Greenwald2014]_. Thanks to this massive amount
   of data, these
   governmental agencies have been able to extract lots of information about
   the behaviour of Internet users. Like Eve, they are in a position to extract
   passwords, usernames and other privacy sensitive data from all the packets
   that they have captured. However, it seems that these agencies were often
   more interested in various meta data, e.g. information showing with whom a
   given user communicates than the actual data exchanged. These revelations
   have shocked the Internet community and the `Internet Engineering Task Force
   <https://www.ietf.org>`_ that manages the standardisation of Internet
   protocols has declared in :rfc:`7258` that such pervasive monitoring is
   an attack that need to be countered in the development of new protocols.
   Several new protocols and extensions to existing ones
   are being developed to counter these attacks.

.. index:: man in the middle, MITM

Eavesdropping and pervasive monitoring are not the only possible attacks against
a network. Another type of attacker is the active attacker. In the literature,
these attacks are often called `Man in the middle` or `MITM` attacks. Such attacks
occur when one user, let us call him `Mallory`, has managed to configure the
network so that he can both capture and modify the packets exchanged by two
users. The simplest scenario is when Mallory controls a router that is on the
path used by both Alice and Bob. For example, Alice could be connected to a WiFi
access router controlled by Mallory and Bob would be a regular server on the Internet.

.. tikz::
   :libs: positioning, matrix

    \tikzset{router/.style = {rectangle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em}, }
    \tikzset{host/.style = {circle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em}, }
    \node[router] (Mallory) {Mallory};

    \node[host, left=of Mallory] (Alice) {Alice};
    \node[host, right=of Mallory] (Bob) {Bob};


    \path[draw,thick]
    (Alice) edge (Mallory)
    (Mallory) edge (Bob);

As Mallory receives all the packets sent by both Bob and Alice, he can modify
them at will. For example, he could modify the commands sent by Alice to the
server managed by Bob and change the responses sent by the server. This type of
attack is very powerful and sometimes difficult to counter without relying
on advanced cryptographic techniques.

.. man in the middle attack

.. index:: Denial of Service, DoS, DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service

The last type of attack that we consider in this introduction are the `Denial
of Service` or DoS attacks.
During such an attack, the attacker generates enough packets to
saturate a given service and prevent it from operating correctly. The simplest
Denial of Service attack is to send more packets that the bandwidth of the
link that attaches the target to the network. The target could be a single
server, a company or even an entire country. If these packets all come from the
same source, then the victim can identify the attacker and contact the
law enforcement authorities. In practice, such denial of service attacks do
not originate from a single source. The attacker usually compromises a (possibly
very large) set of sources and forces them to send packets to saturate a
given target. Since the attacking traffic comes from a wide range of sources,
it is difficult for the victim to locate the culprit and also to counter the
attack. Saturating a link is the simplest example of `Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS)`
attacks.

In practice, there is a possibility of denial of service attacks as soon as
there is a limited resource somewhere in the network.
This ressource can be the bandwidth of a
link, but it could also be the computational power of a server, its memory or
even the size of tables used by a given protocol implementation. Defending
against real DoS attacks can be difficult, especially if the attacker
controls a large number of sources that are used to launch the attacks. In terms
of bandwidth, DoS attacks composed of a few Gbps to a few tens of
Gbps of traffic are frequent on the Internet. In 2015,
`github.com <http://www.github.com>`_ suffered from a distributed DoS that
reached a top bandwidth of 400 Gbps according to some
`reports <http://www.techworld.com/news/security/worlds-largest-ddos-attack-reached-400gbps-says-arbor-networks-3595715/>`_.

.. index:: reflection attack, amplification

When designing network protocols and applications that will be deployed on a
large scale, it is important to take those DDoS attacks into account. Attackers
use different strategies to launch DDoS attacks. Some have managed to gain
control of a large number of sources by injecting malware on them. Others,
and this is where protocol designers have an important role to play, simply
exploit design flaws in some protocols. Consider a simple request-response
protocol where the client sends a request and the server replies with a
response. Often the response is larger or much larger than the request sent
by the client. Consider that such a simple protocol is used over a datagram
network. When Alice sends a datagram to Bob containing her request, Bob
extracts both the request and Alice's address from the packet. He then sends
his response in a single packet destined to Alice. Mallory would like to create a
DoS attack against Alice without being identified. Since he has studied
the specification of this protocol, he can
send a request to Bob inside a packet having Alice's address
as its source address. Bob will process the request and send his (large)
response to Alice. If the response has the same size as the request, Mallory
is producing a `reflection attack` since his packets are reflected by Bob. Alice
would think that she is attacked by Bob. If there are many servers that operate
the same service as Bob, Mallory could hide behind a large number of
such reflectors. Unfortunately, the reflection attack can also become an
amplification attack. This happens when the response sent by Bob is larger
than the request that it has received. If the response is :math:`k` times larger than
the request, then when Mallory consumes 1 Gbps of bandwidth to send
requests, his victim receives :math:`k` Gbps of attack traffic. Such amplification
attacks are a very important problem and protocol designers should ensure that
they never send a large response before having received the proof that the
request that they have received originated from the source indicated in
the request.


Cryptographic primitives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cryptography techniques have initially been defined and used by spies and armies
to exchange secret information in manner that ensures that adversaries cannot
decode the information even if they capture the message or the person carrying the
message. A wide range of techniques have been defined. The first techniques
relied on their secrecy to operate. One of the first encryption schemes is
attributed to Julius Caesar. When he sent confidential information to his
generals, he would encode each message by replacing each letter with another
letter that is :math:`n` positions after this letter in the alphabet. For example,
the message `SECRET` becomes `VHFUHW` when encoded using Caesar's cipher.
This technique could have puzzled some soldiers during Caesar's wars, but today
even young kids can recover the original message from the ciphered one.

.. index:: Kerckhoff principle

The security of the Caesar cipher depends on the confidentiality of the
algorithm, but experience has shown that it is impossible to assume that
an algorithm will remain secret, even for military applications. Instead,
cryptographic techniques must be designed by assuming that the algorithm will
be public and known to anyone. However, its behaviour must be controlled by a small
parameter, known as the key, that will only be known by the users who
need to communicate secretly. This principle is attributed to Auguste Kerckhoff,
a French cryptographer who first documented it :

     `A cryptographic algorithm should be secure even if the attacker knows
     everything about the system, except one parameter known as the secret key.`

This principle is important because it remains the basic assumption of all
cryptographers. Any system that relies on the secrecy of its algorithm
to be considered secure is doomed to fail and be broken one day.

With the Kerckhoff principle, we can now discuss a simple but powerful
encryption scheme that relies on the `XOR` logic operation. This operation is
easily implemented in hardware and is supported by all microprocessors. Given a
secret, :math:`K`, it is possible to encode a message `M` by computing
:math:`C_M = K \oplus M`. The receiver of this messages can recover the original
message as since :math:`M = K \oplus (K \oplus M)`. This `XOR` operation is the
key operation of the perfect cipher that is also called the Vernam cipher or
the one-time pad. This cipher relies on a key that contains purely random
bits. The encrypted message is then produced by XORing all the bits of the
message with all the bits of the key. Since the key is random, it is impossible
for an attacker to recover the original text (or plain text) from the encrypted
one. From a security viewpoint, the one-time-pad is the best solution provided that
the key is as long as the message.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to use this cipher in practice since the key must be as
long as the message that needs to be transmitted. If the key is smaller than the
message and the message is divided into blocks that have the same length as
the key, then the scheme becomes less secure since the same key is used to
decrypt different parts of the message. In practice, `XOR` is often one of the
basic operations used by encryption schemes. To be useable, the deployed
encryption schemes use keys that are composed of a small number of bits, typically
56, 64, 128, 256, ...

A secret key encryption scheme is a perfectly reversible
functions, i.e. given an encryption function `E`, there is an associated
decryption function `D` such that :math:`\forall k \forall M : D(K, E(M,K))=M`.

.. index:: DES

Various secret key cryptographic functions have been proposed, implemented and
deployed. The most popular ones are :

 - DES, the Data Encryption Standard that became a standard in 1977 and has
   been widely used by industry. It uses 56 bits keys that are not considered
   sufficiently secure nowadays since attackers can launch brute-force
   attacks by testing all possible keys. Triple DES combines three 56 bits keys,
   making the brute force attacks more difficult.
 - RC4 is an encryption scheme defined in the late 1980s by Ron Rivest for RSA
   Security. Given the speed of its software implementation, it has been included in
   various protocols and implementations. However, cryptographers have
   identified several weaknesses in this algorithm. It is now deprecated
   and should not be used anymore :rfc:`7465`.
 - AES or the Advanced Encryption Standard is an encryption scheme that was
   designed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen
   in 2001 [DR2002]_. This algorithm  has been standardised by the U.S.
   National Institute
   of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is now used by a wide range of
   applications and various hardware and software implementations exist. Many
   microprocessors include special instructions that ease the implementation
   of AES. AES divides the message to be encrypted in blocks of 128 bits and
   uses keys of length 128, 192 or 256 bits. The block size and the key length
   are important parameters of an encryption scheme. The block size indicates
   the smallest message that can be encrypted and forces the sender to divide
   each message in blocks of the supported size. If the message is larger than
   an integer number of blocks, then the message must be padded before being
   encrypted and this padding must be removed after decryption. The key size
   indicates the resistance of the encryption scheme against brute force
   attacks, i.e. attacks where the attacker tries all possible keys to find
   the correct one.


AES is widely used as of this writing, but other secret key encryption schemes
continue to appear. ChaCha20, proposed by D. Bernstein is now used by
several internet protocols :rfc:`7539`. A detailed discussion of encryption
schemes is outside the scope of this book. We will consider encryption schemes
as black boxes whose operation depends on a single key. A detailed overview
of several of these schemes may be found in [MVV2011]_.

.. index:: public key cryptography

In the 1970s, Diffie and Hellman proposed in their seminal paper [DH1976]_, a
different type of encryption : `public key cryptography`. In public key
cryptography, each user has two different keys :

 - a public key (:math:`K_{pub}`) that he can distribute to everyone
 - a private key (:math:`K_{priv}`) that he needs to store in a secure
   manner and never reveal to anyone

These two keys are generated together and they are linked by a complex
mathematical relationship that is such that it is computationally difficult
to compute :math:`K_{priv}` from :math:`K_{pub}`.

A public key cryptographic scheme is a combination of two functions :

 - an encryption function, `E_p`, that takes a key and a message as parameters
 - a decryption function, `D_p`, that takes a key and a message as parameters

The public key is used to encrypt a message so that it can only be read by
the intended recipient. For example, let us consider two users : Alice and Bob.
Alice (resp. Bob) uses the keys :math:`A_{priv}` and :math:`A_{pub}` (resp.
:math:`B_{priv}` and :math:`B_{pub}`). To send a secure message `M` to Alice,
Bob computes :math:`CM=E_p(A_{pub},M)` and Alice can decrypt it by using
:math:`D_p(A_{priv},CM)=D_p(A_{priv},E_p(A_{pub},M))=M`.

Several public key encryption schemes have been proposed. Two of them have
reached wide deployment :

 - The Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm [#frsa]_ proposed in
   [RSA1978]_ that relies on modular exponentiation with large integers.
 - The Elliptic Curve Cryptography techniques [#fecc]_ that rely on special
   properties of elliptic curves.

Another interesting property of public key cryptography is its ability to
compute `signatures` that can be used to authenticate a message. This capability
comes from the utilisation of two different keys that are linked together.
If Alice wants to sign a message `M`, she can compute
:math:`SM=E_p(A_{priv},M)`. Anyone who receives this signed messaged can extract
its content as :math:`D_p(A_{pub},SM)=D_p(A_{pub},E_p(A_{priv},M))=M`. Everyone
can use :math:`A_{pub}` to check that the message was signed by using
Alice's private key (:math:`A_{priv}`). Since this key is only known
by Alice, the ability to decrypt `SM` is a proof that the message was signed
by Alice herself.

In practice, encrypting a message to sign it can be computationally costly,
in particular if the message is a large file. A faster solution would be
to summarise the document and only sign the summary of the document. A naive
approach could be based on a checksum or CRC computed over the message. Alice
would then compute :math:`C=Checksum(M)` and :math:`SC=E_p(A_{priv},C)`. She
would then send both `M` and `SC` to the recipient of the message who can
easily compute `C` from `SC` and verify the authenticity of the message. Unfortunately,
this solution does not protect Alice and the message's recipient against
a man-in-the-middle attack. If Mallory can intercept the message sent by Alice,
he can easily modify Alice's message and tweak it so that it has the same
checksum as the original one. The CRCs, although more complex to compute,
suffer from the same problem.

.. index: cryptographic hash function, avalanche effect

.. wikipedia illustration is nice https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5

To efficiently sign messages, Alice needs to be able to compute a summary
of her message in a way that prohibits an attacker from generating a
different message that has the same summary. `Cryptographic hash functions`
were designed to solve this problem. The ideal hash function is a function
that returns a different number for every possible input. In practice, it
is impossible to find such a function. Cryptographic hash functions are an
approximation of this perfect summarisation function. They
compute a summary of a given message in 128, 160, 256 bits or more. They also
exhibit the `avalanche effect`. This effect indicates that a small change in
the message causes a large change in the hash value. Finally hash functions
are very difficult to invert. Knowing a hash value, it is computationally very
difficult to find the corresponding input message. Several hash functions have
been proposed by cryptographers. The most popular ones are :

 - MD5, originally proposed in :rfc:`1321`. It has been used in a wide range of
   applications. In 2010, attacks against MD5 were published and this hash
   function is now deprecated.
 - SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that was standardised by the
   NIST in 1995. It outputs 160 bits results. It is now used in a variety
   of network protocols.
 - SHA-2 is another family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the NIST.
   Different variants of SHA-2 can produce has values of 224, 256, 384 or 512
   bits.


Another important point about cryptographic algorithms is that often these
algorithms require random numbers to operate correctly (e.g. to generate
keys). Generating good random numbers is difficult and any implementation
of cryptographic algorithms should also include a secure random number
generator. :rfc:`4086` provides useful recommendations.

Cryptographic protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can now combine the cryptographic operations described in the previous section
to build some protocols to securely exchange
information. Let us first go back to the problem of authenticating
Alice on Bob's computer. We have shown earlier that using
a simple password for this purpose is insecure in the presence of attackers.


A naive approach would be to rely on hash functions. Since hash functions
are non-invertible, Alice and Bob could decide to use them to exchange Alice's
password in a secure manner. Then, Alice could be authenticated by using
the following exchange.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Prove it\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "Hash(passwd)\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Access granted\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

.. index:: replay attack

Since the hash function cannot be inverted, an eavesdropper cannot extract
Alice's password by simply observing the data exchanged. However, Alice's
real password is not the objective of an attacker. The main objective for
Mallory is to be authenticated as Alice. If Mallory can capture
`Hash(passwd)`, he can simply replay this data, without being able to invert
the hash function. This is called a `replay attack`.

To counter this replay attack, we need to ensure that Alice never sends the
same information twice to Bob. A possible mode of operation is shown below.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Challenge:764192\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "Hash(764192||passwd)\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Access\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

.. index:: nonce

To authenticate herself, Alice sends her userid to Bob. Bob replies with
a random number as a challenge to verify that Alice knows the shared secret
(i.e. her password). Alice replies with the result of the computation
of a hash function (e.g. SHA-1) over a string that is the concatenation
between the random number chosen by Bob and Alice's password. The random
number chosen by Bob is often called a `nonce` since this is a number
that should only be used once. Bob performs the
same computation locally and can check the message returned by Alice.
This type of authentication scheme has been used in various protocols. It
prevents replay attacks. If Eve captures the messages exchanged by
Alice and Bob, she cannot recover Alice's password from the messages exchanged
since hash functions are non-invertible. Furthermore, she cannot replay the
hashed value since Bob will always send a different nonce.

Unfortunately, this solution forces Bob to store Alice's password in clear. Any
breach in the security of Bob's computer would reveal Alice's password. Such
breaches unfortunately occur and some of them have led to the dissemination of
millions of passwords.

.. index:: hash chain

A better approach would be to authenticate Alice without storing her password
in clear on Bob's computer. For this, Alice computes a `hash chain`
as proposed by Lamport in [Lamport1981]_. A hash
chain is a sequence of applications of a hash function (`H`) on an input string. If
Alice's password is `P`, then her 10 steps hash chain is :
:math:`H(H(H(H(H(H(H(H(H(H(P))))))))))`. The result of this hash chain will
be stored on Bob's computer together with the value `10`. This number is the
maximum number of remaining authentications for Alice on Bob's computer.
To authenticate Alice, Bob sends the remaining number of authentications, i.e.
`10` in this example. Since Alice knows her password, `P`, she can compute
:math:`H^9(P)=H(H(H(H(H(H(H(H(H(P)))))))))` and send this information to Bob.
Bob computes the hash of the value received from Alice (:math:`H(H^9(P))`)
and verifies that this value is equal to the value stored in his database. It
then decrements the number of authorised authentications and stores
:math:`H^9(P)` in his database. Bob is now ready for the next authentication
of Alice. When the number of authorised authentications reaches zero, the
hash chain needs to be reinitialised. If Eve captures :math:`(H^n(P))`, she
cannot use it to authenticate herself as Alice on Bob's computer because
Bob will have decremented its number of authorised authentications. Furthermore,
given that hash functions are not invertible, Eve cannot compute
:math:`H^{n-1}(P)` from :math:`H^{n}(P)`.

The two protocols above prevent eavesdropping attacks, but not man-in-the-middle
attacks. If Mallory can intercept the messages sent by Alice, he could force
her to reveal :math:`H^n(P)` and then use this information to authenticate
as Alice on Bob's computer. In practice, hash chains should only be used when
the communicating users know that there cannot be any man-in-the-middle on
their communication.

Public key cryptography provides another possibility to allow Alice
to authenticate herself on Bob's computer. Assume again that Alice and
Bob know each other from previous encounters. Alice knows Bob's public key
(:math:`Bob_{pub}`) and Bob also knows Alice's key (:math:`Alice_{pub}`). To
authenticate herself, Alice could send her userid. Bob would reply
with a random number encrypted with Alice's public key :
:math:`E_p(Alice_{pub},R)`. Alice can decrypt this message to recover `R`
and sends :math:`E_p(Bob_{pub},R)`. Bob decrypts the nonce and confirms that
Alice knows :math:`Alice_{priv}`. If an eavesdropper captures the
messages exchanged, he cannot recover the value `R` which could be used as
a key to encrypt the information with a secret key algorithm.
This is illustrated in the time sequence diagram below.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "E_p(Alice_{pub},R)", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "E_p(Bob_{pub},R)", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];


A drawback of this approach is that Bob is forced to perform two
public key computations : one encryption to send the random nonce
to Alice and one decryption to recover the nonce encrypted by Alice.
If these computations are costly from a CPU viewpoint, this creates
a risk of Denial of Service Attacks were attackers could try to
access Bob's computer and force it to perform such costly computations.
Bob is more at risk than Alice in this situation and he should not perform
complex operations before being sure that he is talking with Alice.
An alternative is shown in the time sequence diagram below.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "R\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "E_p(Alice_{priv},R)\n\n", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

Here, Bob simply sends a random nonce to Alice and verifies her signature.
Since the random nonce and the signature could be captured by an eavesdropper,
they cannot be used as a secret key to encrypt further data. However
Bob could propose a secret key and send it encrypted with Alice's
public key in response to the signed nonce that he received.


The solution described above works provided that Bob and Alice know their
respective public keys before communicating. Otherwise, the protocol is not secure against
man-in-the-middle attackers. Consider Mallory sitting in the middle
between Alice and Bob and assume that neither Alice nor Bob knows
the other's public key.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      x [label="", linecolour=white],
      y [label="Mallory", textcolour="red", linecolour=red],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = " " ] ,
      b>>y [ label = "I'm Alice key=Alice_{pub}", arcskip="1" ];
      y>>c [ label = "I'm Alice key=Mallory_{pub}", textcolour="red", arcskip="1" ];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "R", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>y [ label = "E_p(Alice_{priv},R)", arcskip="1"];
      y>>c [ label = "E_p(Mallory_{priv},R)", textcolour="red",  arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Access", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

In the above example, Alice sends her public key, (:math:`Alice_{pub}`), in
her first message together with her identity. Mallory intercepts the message
and replaces Alice's key with his own key, (:math:`Mallory_{pub}`). Bob
replies with a nonce, `R`. Alice then signs the random
nonce to prove that she knows :math:`Alice_{priv}`. Mallory discards the
information and instead computes :math:`E_p(Mallory_{priv},R)`. Bob now
thinks that he is discussing with Alice while Mallory sits in the middle.


There are situations where symmetric authentication is required. In this case,
each user must perform some computation with his/her private key. A possible
exchange is the following. Alice sends her certificate to Bob. Bob replies with
a nonce, :math:`R1`, and provides his certificate. Alice encrypts :math:`R1` with
her private key and generates a nonce, :math:`R2`. Bob verifies Alice's computation
and encrypts :math:`R2` with his private key. Alice verifies the computation and
both have been authenticated.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Challenge:R1", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "E_p(Alice_{priv},R1),R2", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "E_p(Bob_{priv},R2)", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];


The protocol described above works, but it takes a long time for Bob to authenticate
Alice and for Alice to authenticate Bob. A faster authentification could be the following.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice, R2", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Challenge:R1,E_p(Bob_{priv},R2)", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "E_p(Alice_{priv},R1)", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];


Alice sends her random nonce, :math:`R2`. Bob signs :math:`R2` and sends his nonce :
:math:`R1`. Alice signs :math:`R1` and both are authenticated.


Now consider that Mallory wants to be authenticated as Alice. The above protocol
has a subtle flaw that could be exploited by Mallory. This flaw can be exploited if
Alice and Bob can act as both client and server. Knowing this, Mallory could operate
as follows. Mallory starts an authentication with Bob faking himself as Alice.
He sends a first message to Bob including Alice's identity.


  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Mallory", textcolour="red", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Alice,RA", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Challenge:RB,E_p(Bob_{priv},RA)", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];


In this exchange, Bob authenticates himself by signing the :math:`RA` nonce that was
sent by Mallory. Now, to authenticate as Alice, Mallory needs to compute
the signature of nonce :math:`RB` with Alice's private key. Mallory does not
know Alice's key, but he could exploit the protocol to force Alice to
perform the required computation. For this, Mallory can start an
authentication to Alice as shown below.

  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Mallory", textcolour="red",linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "I'm Mallory,RB", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "Challenge:RX,E_p(Alice_{priv},RB)", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

In this example, Mallory has forced Alice to compute
:math:`E_p(Alice_{priv},RB)` which is the information required to
finalise the first exchange and be authenticated as Alice. This
illustrates a common problem with authentication schemes when the same
information can be used for different purposes. The problem comes from
the fact that Alice agrees to compute her signature on a nonce chosen
by Bob (and relayed by Mallory). This problem occurs if the nonce is a
simple integer without any structure. If the nonce includes some structure
such as some information about Alice and Bob's identities or even a
single bit indicating whether the nonce was chosen by a user acting as
a client (i.e. starting the authentication) or as a server, then the
protocol is not vulnerable anymore.

.. index:: certificates, trusted third party

To cope with some of the above mentioned problems,
public-key cryptography is usually combined with
certificates. A `certificate` is a data structure that includes a signature from
a trusted third party. A simple explanation of the utilisation of certificates
is to consider that Alice and Bob both know Ted. Ted is trusted by these
two users and both have stored Ted's public key : :math:`Ted_{pub}`. Since they
both know Ted's key, he can issue certificates. A certificate is mainly a
cryptographic link between the identity of a user and his/her public key.
Such a certificate can be computed in different ways. A simple solution is for
Ted to generate a file that contains the following information
for each certified user :

 - his/her identity
 - his/her public key
 - a hash of the entire file signed with Ted's private key

Then, knowing Ted's public key, anyone can verify the validity of a certificate.
When a user sends his/her public key, he/she must also attach the certificate to
prove the link between his/her identity and the public key. In practice,
certificates are more complex than this.
Certificates will often be used to authenticate the
server and sometimes to authenticate the client.

A possible protocol could then be the following. Alice sends
:math:`Cert(Alice_{pub},Ted)`. Bob replies with a random nonce.


  .. msc::

      a [label="", linecolour=white],
      b [label="Alice", linecolour=black],
      z [label="", linecolour=white],
      c [label="Bob", linecolour=black],
      d [label="", linecolour=white];

      a=>b [ label = "" ] ,
      b>>c [ label = "Cert(Alice_{pub},Ted)", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];

      d=>c [ label = "" ] ,
      c>>b [ label = "R", arcskip="1"];
      b=>a [ label = "" ];

      a=>b [ label = ""] ,
      b>>c [ label = "E_p(Alice_{priv},R)", arcskip="1"];
      c=>d [ label = "" ];


Until now, we have only discussed the authentication problem. This is an
important but not sufficient step to have a secure communication between two
users through an unsecure network. To securely exchange information, Alice
and Bob need to both :

 - mutually authenticate each other
 - agree on a way to encrypt the messages that they will exchange

Let us first explore how this could be realised by using public-key
cryptography. We assume that Alice and Bob have both a public-private
key pair and the corresponding certificates signed by a trusted
third party : Ted.

A possible protocol would be the following.
Alice sends :math:`Cert(Alice_{pub},Ted)`. This certificate provides Alice's
identity and her public key.
Bob replies with the certificate containing his own public key :
:math:`Cert(Bob_{pub},Ted)`. At this point, they both know the
other public key and could use it to send encrypted messages.
Alice would send :math:`E_p(Bob_{pub},M1)` and Bob would send
:math:`E_p(Alice_{pub},M2)`. In practice, using public key encryption
techniques to encrypt a large number of messages is inefficient because
these cryptosystems require a large number of computations. It is more
efficient to use secret key cryptosystems for most of the data and only
use a public key cryptosystem to encrypt the random secret keys that
will be used by the secret key encryption scheme.

Key exchange
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When users want to communicate securely through a network,
they need to exchange information such as the keys that will be
used by an encryption algorithm even in the presence of an
eavesdropper. The most widely used algorithm that allows
two users to safely exchange an integer in the presence of
an eavesdropper is the one proposed by Diffie and Hellman [DH1976]_.
It operates with (large) integers. Two of them are public, the modulus, p,
which is prime and the base, g, which must be a primitive root of p.
The communicating users select a random integer, :math:`a` for Alice and :math:`b` for
Bob. The exchange starts as :

 - Alice selects a random integer, :math:`a` and sends
   :math:`A=g^{a} mod p` to Bob
 - Bob selects a random integer, :math:`b` and sends
   :math:`B=g^{b} mod p` to Alice
 - From her knowledge of :math:`a` and :math:`B`, Alice can compute
   :math:`Secret=B^{a} mod p= (g^{b} mod p) ^{a} mod p=g^{a \times b} mod p`
 - From is knowledge of :math:`b` and :math:`A`, Bob can compute
   :math:`Secret=A^{b} mod p=(g^{a} mod p) ^{b} mod p=g^{a \times b} mod p`

The security of this protocol relies on the difficulty of computing
discrete logarithms, i.e. from the knowledge of :math:`A` (resp. :math:`B`),
it is very difficult to extract :math:`log(A)=log(g^{a} mod p)=a`
(resp. :math:`log(B)=log(g^{b} mod p)=b`).

An example of the utilisation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is
shown below. Before starting the exchange, Alice
and Bob agree on a modulus (:math:`p=23`) and a base (:math:`g=5`). These two
numbers are public. They are typically part of the standard that defines
the protocol that uses the key exchange.

  -  Alice chooses a secret integer : :math:`a=8` and sends
     :math:`A= g^{a} mod p= 5^{8} mod 23=16` to Bob
  - Bob chooses a secret integer : :math:`b=13` and sends
    :math:`B= g^{b} mod p=5^{13} mod 23=21` to Alice
  - Alice computes :math:`S_{A}=B^{a} mod p= 21^{8} mod 23=3`
  - Bob computes :math:`S_{B}=A^{b} mod p= 16^{13} mod 23=3`

Alice and Bob have agreed on the secret information :math:`3` without
having sent it explicitly through the network. If the integers used are
large enough and have good properties, then even Eve who can capture all
the messages sent by Alice and Bob cannot recover the secret key that
they have exchanged. There is no formal proof of the security of
the algorithm, but mathematicians have tried to solve similar problems with
integers during centuries without finding an efficient algorithm. As
long as the integers that are used are random and large enough, the only
possible attack for Eve is to test all possible integers that could have
been chosen by Alice and Bob. This is computationally very expensive.
This algorithm is widely used in security protocols to agree on a secret key.

Unfortunately, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange alone cannot cope with man-in-the
middle attacks. Consider Mallory who sits in the middle between Alice and
Bob and can easily capture and modify their messages. The modulus
and the base are public. They are thus known by Mallory as well. He
could then operate as follows :

 - Alice chooses a secret integer and sends :math:`A= g^{a} mod p` to Mallory
 - Mallory generates a secret integer, :math:`m` and sends
  :math:`M=g^{m} mod p` to Bob
 - Bob chooses a secret integer and sends :math:`B=g^{b} mod p` to Mallory
 - Mallory computes :math:`S_{A}=A^{m} mod p` and :math:`S_{B}=B^{m} mod p`
 - Alice computes :math:`S_{A}=M^{a} mod p` and uses this key to communicate
   with Mallory (acting as Bob)
 - Bob computes :math:`S_{B}=M^{b} mod p` and uses this key to communicate with
   Mallory (acting as Alice)

When Alice sends a message, she encrypts it with :math:`S_{A}`. Mallory
decrypts it with :math:`S_{A}` and encrypts the plaintext with
:math:`S_{B}`. When Bob receives the message, he can decrypt it
by using :math:`S_{B}`.

To safely use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Alice and Bob must use
an `authenticated` exchange. Some of the information sent by Alice or Bob
must be signed with a public key known by the other user. In practice,
it is often important for Alice to authenticate Bob. If Bob has a
certificated signed by Ted, the authenticated key exchange could
be organised as follows.

  -  Alice chooses a secret integer : :math:`a` and sends
     :math:`A= g^{a} mod p` to Bob
  - Bob chooses a secret integer : :math:`b`, computes
    :math:`B= g^{b} mod p` and sends
    :math:`Cert(Bob,Bob_{pub},Ted), E_p(Bob_{priv},B)` to Alice
  - Alice checks the signature (with :math:`Bob_{pub}`)
    and the certificate and computes :math:`S_{A}=B^{a} mod p`
  - Bob computes :math:`S_{B}=A^{b} mod p`

This prevents the attack mentioned above since Mallory cannot create a
fake certificate and cannot sign a value by using Bob's private key. Given
the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
mechanism should never be used without authentification.
