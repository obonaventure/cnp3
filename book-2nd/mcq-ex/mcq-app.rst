The Domain Name System
----------------------

.. question:: DNS1
   :nb_prop: 3
   :nb_pos: 1

   1. Which of the following DNS Resource Records should be queried to retrieve the IPv6 address associated to a name ? 

   .. positive:: The `AAAA` record. 

   .. negative:: The `A` record. 

      .. comment:: This record is used to retrieve the IPv4 address associated to a name.

   .. negative:: The `NS` record.

      .. comment:: This record is used to retrieve the name server that is responsible for a given domain name.

   .. negative:: The `MX` record.

      .. comment:: This record is used to retrieve the mail server that is responsible for a given domain name.


.. question:: DNS2
   :nb_prop: 3
   :nb_pos: 1

   2. You use the DNS to retrieve the `IPv4` address associated to the name `cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be`. Assuming that you need to start your query from the root of the domain name system, which of the following DNS record will you *never* query to obtain this information.

   .. negative:: The `AAAA` record. 

      .. comment:: This record is used to retrieve the IPv6 address associated to a name. Although you query an IPv4 address, you might need to query a nameserver that uses IPv6 to retrieve this information.

      .. comment:: This record is used to retrieve the IPv4 address associated to a name.

   .. negative:: The `NS` record.

.. question:: base64
   :nb_prop: 3
   :nb_pos: 1

   4. The Base64 format, defined in :rfc:`2045` and :rfc:`4648` allows to encode any binary information in a sequence of ASCII characters. Only one affirmation below concerning Base64 is valid. Which one ?

   .. positive:: Base64 encodes three 8 bits ASCII characters as a sequence of four characters. 

   .. negative:: Base64 encodes four 8 bits ASCII characters as a sequence of three characters. 

   .. positive:: A Base64 encoded string may contains the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9` as well as `+`, `/` and `=` 

   .. negative:: A Base64 encoded string can only contain letters (`A-Z` and `a-z`) and digits (`0-9`)

      .. comment:: This is not sufficient. Base64 requires 64 different symbols. By using the letters and digits, there are only 62 symbols.

   .. positive:: A Base64 encoded string may contain the character `=`.

      .. comment:: This happens when the number of bytes to be encoded is not a multiple of three.

   .. negative:: A Base64 encoded string may never contain the character `=`.
      .. comment:: This character may be used, only in the last characters of the Base64 encoded string if the number of bytes to be encoded is not a multiple of three.

The HyperText Transfer Protocol
-------------------------------   

.. question:: http1
   :nb_pos: 2
   :nb_prop: 4

   1. The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) defined in :rfc:`3986` are a key element of the `world wide web`. Among the URIs below, select the ones that are valid URIs.

   .. positive:: ``http://example.net``

   .. negative:: ``http:example.net``
 
      .. comment:: In a URI, must be followed by the characters `:` and ``//``
   .. positive:: ``http://example.net@/example.com``

      .. comment:: This URI is valid, the string ``example.net`` corresponds to the authority part of the BNF that defines the format of the URI.

   .. negative:: ``http://example.com:user/index.html``

      .. comment:: This URI is invalid, the string ``example.com`` corresponds to a server name. The string after the `:` should be an integer that represents a port number. 

   .. negative:: ``http:80//example.com/index.html``

      .. comment:: This URI is invalid, the string ``example.com`` corresponds to a server name. To indicate a port number, `:80` should appear after ``example.com``.

   .. positive:: The `Last-Modified` header line is included in the HTTP responses. It contains as parameter the last modification date of the retrieved document.

   .. negative:: The `User-Agent` header line can appear inside HTTP responses. It indicates the application that should process the response.

      .. comment:: This is incorrect, this header line can only appear inside HTTP requests. It indicates the application that was used to create the HTTP request.
