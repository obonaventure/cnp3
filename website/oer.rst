Open Educational Resources
==========================


In parallel with the development of the :ref:`Computer Networking : Principles, Protocols and Practice ebook <2nded:toc>` ebook, we have also developed a series of Open Educational Resources which could be useful for professors who teach networking courses. These resources are available from `https://github.com/CNP3 <https://github.com/CNP3>`_ and are briefly described in the paper `Scaling Networking Education with Open Educational Resources <https://arxiv.org>`_ that summarises our experience in developing and using them. 

 - `https://github.com/cnp3/project-transport-protocol <https://github.com/cnp3/project-transport-protocol>`_ is a student project (written in French, but we hope someone will help to translate it in English) during which students learn to write their own transport protocol. It uses `https://github.com/cnp3/Linksimulator <https://github.com/cnp3/Linksimulator>`_ to simulate losses, errors and reordering on links.
 - `https://github.com/cnp3/ipmininet <https://github.com/cnp3/ipmininet>`_ are a set of extensions to Mininet that aid the configuration of IPv6 and routing protocols. Examples are provided in `https://github.com/cnp3/RoutingExamples <https://github.com/cnp3/RoutingExamples>`_
 - `https://github.com/cnp3/MCQ <https://github.com/cnp3/MCQ>`_ contains dozens of multiple choice questions
 - `https://github.com/cnp3/CampusNetwork <https://github.com/cnp3/CampusNetwork>`_ contains all the information about a six-weeks long project during which the students prepare the next version of our campus network. 

We are currently preparing the third edition of the ebook. This new edition will be more interactive and include various types of online exercises hosted on the `INGINious code grading platform <https://www.inginious.org>`_.

 - `https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-problems-network-trace <https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-problems-network-trace>`_ is an extension to the `INGINious code grading platform <https://www.inginious.org>`_ that enables students to interact with packets by reordering them or filling missing fields. Sample exercises are available from `https://inginious.org/course/cnp3 <https://inginious.org/course/cnp3>`_ . Their source code is available from `https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-packets <https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-packets>`_. 
 - `https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-C <https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-C>`_ contains the source code for exercises related to the utilisation of the socket API in C. These exercises can be tested from `https://inginious.org/course/cnp3 <https://inginious.org/course/cnp3>`_ 
 - `https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-open <https://github.com/cnp3/INGInious-open>`_ contains the source code for exercises that illustrate how open-questions can be written on the `INGINious code grading platform <https://www.inginious.org>`_ . These exercises can be tested from `https://inginious.org/course/cnp3 <https://inginious.org/course/cnp3>`_
